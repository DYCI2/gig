The Generative Interactive Agents Library is a high-level API to design generative agents for interactive music generation. It is used as a basis for the [DYCI2](https://github.com/DYCI2/DYCI2-Python-Library) and [Somax2](https://github.com/DYCI2/Somax2) environments.

This library was developed by Joakim Borg, designed by Joakim Borg and Jérôme Nika within the framework of the projects ANR-DYCI2, ANR-MERCI, ERC-REACH in the Music Representations team (part of the joint research lab UMR STMS IRCAM-CNRS-UPMC) directed by Gérard Assayag.
